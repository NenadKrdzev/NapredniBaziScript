# Advanced Databases Project
A database project I built with my colleagues.
## Project description
The project is a social media app designed for musicians. Some of the features include:

1. Users can post an event with included location, date, time, and description.
2. Bands can post an audition with details of what they are looking for.
3. Bands can post their own music.
4. Users and bands can interact with other users' or bands' work.
5. Users can create ordinary posts such as videos or blogs.
6. Users can apply to any audition using videos.
7. Users can interact with posts through comments and likes.
And many more.

## Technology used:
We solely used PostgreSQL to create this project. We implemented many of the features provided by PostgreSQL, such as views, procedures, functions, and indexes. Additionally, we populated our tables with a substantial amount of data to ensure stability. Our largest table, 'Korisnik,' contains 100,100 entries.
